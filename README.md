# Automail #
This package is a solution to project 1 of SWEN30006 - Software Modelling and Design,
the Univerity of Melbourne. Specifications can found in the repo.

This program is a simulation called MailPool, which is software that would, in theory,
govern how an automated mail delivery system operates in a residential building. The 
goal of the system is to calculate costs related to mail delivery as well as keep a 
log of actions, items delivered and the robots that deliver them.

Run instructions:  
- IntelliJ: The repo is set up so that it can be cloned and simply built/run on 
IntelliJ.
- Other IDES: the src folder and automail.properties file will need to be extracted
to run in other environments.

Modifying settings:  
The automail.properties file contains the properties that govern how the program will
operate. Settings can be safely modified here.
